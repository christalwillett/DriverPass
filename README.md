# DriverPass

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client of the project is DriverPass. They wanted a system that helped student drivers prepare for their in-car driving test; The client required that the students have online tests available as well as progress to be recorded to inform the student of their strengths and weaknesses. What did you do particularly well?

For the project, I feel that I made the presentation very well; I included useful information and charts for clarity. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? One thing I would revise to improve these documents is the information mentioned about the objectives and goals of the DriverPass system; I feel that I should have been more specific and thorough about many more goals for the system.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

As a user of DriverPass, I thought of how this system might help them better their experience for their driving test. I also thought about the ways in which the user would not benefit from a given aspect of the system that I'd considered. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing because the system is designed for a specific user in mind; If the system were designed for users in a way that was confusing and difficult to navigate, not many people would choose to use the system. It's good to consider the user as designing the system to accomodate a given user aids in creating successful software. How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

Some approaches that I will consider in the future when designing software entails putting together business requirement documents as well as using charts for visualizing what each member of the team is responsible for.
